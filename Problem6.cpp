 *    @brief   Project Euler - Problem 6 (Sum square difference)
 *
 *    @section Description
 *    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *    12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 *    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 *    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 *    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
